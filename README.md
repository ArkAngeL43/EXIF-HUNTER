                     Exif Hunter: A Framework for image injection with Go and Perl
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

This is a simple script that is still in beta mode rn, the concept of this script is to just inject an image, find data on the image and inject it with certian data. The idea of this script was to improove a image injection module to give the user more information like the Offset of the IEND tags. there isnt much to this right now as this script is still in beta (v .1) and will be further looked into and be another project to finish!
